## Context

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/https:/), to learn web development, we were asked in a [practice assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-pagehttps:/) to build a landing page that looks like [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.pnghttps:/). We had to stick to the layout form, we were free to use our own content.

After hours of moving things around with CSS and HTML, the layout was done, and the content was placeholder text by `Lorem Ipsum`.

Just before publishing the page live with GitHub Pages. I thought maybe it is better to publish content with value rather than some random words. Since the page will go live, and who knows who will see it (it is the internet, after all!).

While thinking of something worth sharing, I heard the news about the ceasefire in Gaza. And I said, well, let's make it a fundraising page for these people.

And this is how *WebDev For Gaza* came to life. ([This is me right now!](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/05/26/honest-work-meme-c7034f8bd7b11467e1bfbe14b87a5f6a14a5274b.jpg))
